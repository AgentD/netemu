This directory contains the source code of a simple network emulation tool
that uses Linux Network Namespaces to emulate a network setup that it reads
from a textual description.

It is loosely based on a set of highly specialized tools I developed at work.

This is a "clean" rewrite from scratch for my bachelor thesis at the
university of Innsbruck.


To use this, you will need:
  - A kernel with namespace support, i.e. a recent kernel
  - A libc with namespace support, i.e. something more recent than CentOS 6
  - gcc, make
  - maybe other stuff that I didn't think of


Run make to build everything. It generates two tools: nettool and testtool.

The program "nettool" manages virtual networks. And is run like this:

  nettool <configfile> [start|stop|graph]

The target "start" creates the virtual network, "stop" destroys the existing
virtual network and "graph" wrties commands to stdout that can be piped into
one of the dot tools to generate a graph.

Example:

  ./nettool demo/nat.cfg graph | sfdp -T svg > test.svg


The program "testtool" runs a list of automated tests inside a virtual network
and checks for success/failure exit status.


Example configurations can be found in the "demo" subdirectory.
